# JavaScript Dom Workshop

 #### Welcome to the JavaScript Workshop!

## Workshop Summary

In this workshop, you will learn how to build a Contact Manager application using JavaScript, HTML, and BOOTSTRAP. The Contact Manager allows you to store and manage contact information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. You'll learn important JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and working with modules.

Throughout the workshop, you'll build the Contact Manager step by step, starting from a simple HTML structure and gradually adding functionality using JavaScript. The workshop will cover topics such as:

- Creating and updating contact objects using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Dynamically rendering contacts in a table using the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Implementing event handling to enable adding, updating, and deleting contacts.
- Performing search operations to filter contacts based on specific criteria.
- Learnig how write clean code.


Along with learning the core JavaScript concepts, you will also focus on writing clean and maintainable code. The workshop will emphasize best practices for code organization, readability, and following coding conventions. You'll learn techniques for structuring your code, using meaningful variable and function names, and writing comments to enhance code clarity and maintainability.

By the end of the workshop, you will have a fully functional Contact Manager application that not only demonstrates your knowledge of JavaScript concepts but also showcases your ability to write clean and well-structured code.
